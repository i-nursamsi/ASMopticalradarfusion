This script is developed in Google Earth Engine to map Artisanal small-scale mining in Kalimantan, Indonesia.
All of the code is written in GEE Javascript.

This study aims to develop and test a methodology for mapping ASGM at the regional scale of Kalimantan Island, spanning approximately 500,000 km2, utilizing a time series of satellite multi-spectral and radar datasets processed within the GEE platform. The methodology will be tested in Central Kalimantan, a well-established ASGM hotspot, prior to being scaled up to encompass the entire island. The study's workflow comprises several stages : (1) pre-processing and generation of features (covariates) from both multi-spectral and radar data which includes the individual bands and selected indices; (2) feature-level data fusion; (3) training and prediction using a fine-tuned Random Forest (RF) algorithm; (4) post-processing; (5) validation; and (6) scaling up if the overall accuracy surpasses 85% and the false-negative and false-positive errors of the ASGM class are below 30%.

The study leverages a combination of multispectral imageries from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2, along with SAR images from Sentinel-1 and ALOS/PALSAR, in order to maximize the benefits of both passive and active remote sensing data. or each year, a composite of median values of multispectral imageries acquired between April and October during the dry season in Indonesia is created, along with corresponding radar data. The features (covariates) consist of both multispectral and radar-based indices, and all spectral indices used have been demonstrated in previous studies to effectively identify and map features similar to open-pit mining sites (e.g., Almeida-Filho and Shimabukuro (2000); Forkuor et al. (2020); Gao et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2021)). The covariates are stacked as predictors in the classification process and normalized to ensure uniformity of scale.

To generate the training and test samples, covariates values are extracted from the raster stack by employing rectangular polygon sampling techniques in known ASGM sites, with a minimum size of 2 hectares (equivalent to 5x5 pixels of a 30m grain size). The reference sites are sourced from three distinct sources: manual interpretation of Google Earth imagery, government and non-governmental organizations reports on confirmed ASGM locations, and a global digitized mining area dataset from Maus et al. (2022) which encompasses both Large-Scale Mining (LSM) and ASGM sites. The ASGM sites are identified from the Google Earth imagery through visual recognition of characteristic features, such as unvegetated lunar-shaped open-pits, crates, and crevasses formed by surface soil removal, often accompanied by ponds of water used for slushing and washing.

The classification process will be conducted using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE). RF is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm that consists of an ensemble of randomized decision trees (Breiman 2001). Each decision tree predicts a target class for each training sample, and the class with the highest number of votes within the forest is selected as the ensemble's final decision. Due to its robustness to class label noise and high dimensional input data (Belgiu & Drăguţ 2016), it has been tested and found to be accurate in mapping mining areas while capable of distinguish it from other land cover with similar characteristics (Rodriguez-Galiano et al. 2012; Qin et al. 2021). In order to attain the optimal level of accuracy in the classification process, it is imperative to judiciously choose the parameters that significantly impact the outcome. A comprehensive analysis will be conducted to evaluate the effects of two key parameters, namely the Number of Trees and bag fraction, on the accuracy of the classification model. The range of values explored for Number of Trees varied from 10 to 150 with increments of 20, while for the bag fraction, the range of values explored varied from 0.1 to 0.9 with increments of 0.1. This systematic approach aimed to optimize the classification performance by determining the optimal parameter values that would maximize accuracy.
